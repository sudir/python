# Program Usecase
Compute the average quize grade of 5 students

# Generate list of 5 names
name_var = [name1, name2, name3, name4, name5]


# Need to find the largest int from return value so the final values should be a list variable
finalGrades = []

# provide instruction set to instructor for grading
print statement "Grade students from 1 - 100"

# For each of the names in list, prompt for a question of their grade against each name using for loop
for i in name_var:
    print statement "Enter the grade for"+i # need to find a clever way for iteration of name_var list
    take the final input and append it to the list variable "finalGrades"

# print statement and return the final computation of highest sum from finalGrades
print max(finalGrade)
# print statement and return the final computation of average sum from finalGrades 
print average(finalGrade)
