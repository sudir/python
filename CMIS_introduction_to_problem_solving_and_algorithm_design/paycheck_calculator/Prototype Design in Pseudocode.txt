Prototype Design in Pseudocode

Usecase for script:
We ultimately want to calculate a paycheck for final pay with commision added


# Set hourly pay to $40
hourlypay = 40.00

# Need hours worked provided
prompt user for input x number of hours worked

# Generate a variable for calculated pay by multiplying hours worked x hourly rate
pay=( ? * 40.00)

# Set a rate for every sale made
sales = 10.00

# Need X number of sales provided 
prompt user for input x number of sales

# Calculate 50% of sale total to generate variable for commission pay
var3 = (0.5 * ?)


Render final results in the form of weekly pay + commission:
Paycheck=pay+var3
